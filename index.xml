When two parallel lines are cut by another line, called a transversal, two pairs of alternate interior angles are created. (“Interior” means on the inside, or between, the two parallel lines.</description></item><item><title>Dilation</title><link>https://math.boskind.tech/Unit2/Dilation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://math.boskind.tech/Unit2/Dilation/</guid><description>Dilation A dilation is a transformation in which each point on a figure moves along a line (Ray) and changes its distance from a fixed point. The fixed point is the center of the dilation. All of the original distances are multiplied by the same scale factor.</description></item><item><title>Equation of a line</title><link>https://math.boskind.tech/Unit2/EquationofaLine/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://math.boskind.tech/Unit2/EquationofaLine/</guid><description>Equation of a line The equation of a line is the way that we represent the relationship between x and y of every point on a line. The first form of the equation of a line that we will use is Point Slope Form It is called this because it tells us the Slope of the line and a point on the line. The M in the equation is where we put the Slope of the line The point on the line is shown by (X1, Y1)</description></item><item><title>Lesson 1.2</title><link>https://math.boskind.tech/Unit1/Lesson1.2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://math.boskind.tech/Unit1/Lesson1.2/</guid><description>Lesson 1.2 Unit1 Lesson 2 What did I learn Today? Translation- slides a figure without turning it, Rotation- turns a figure about a point, called the center of rotation, and Reflection- is a transformation representing a flip of a figure.And the figure can go clockwise or counterclockwise. i learned what reflection means/ points on the opposite side of a reflection line the mirror image is a backwards copy of the original figure.</description></item><item><title>Lesson 1.3</title><link>https://math.boskind.tech/Unit1/Lesson1.3/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://math.boskind.tech/Unit1/Lesson1.3/</guid><description>Lesson 1.3 Unit1 Lesson 3

A rigid transformation of a line is a line.
A rigid transformation of two parallel lines results in two parallel lines that are the same distance apart as the original two lines.
Sometimes, a rigid transformation takes a line to itself. For example: Unit1Vocab What did I learn today?

These facts let us figure out things without having to measure them! What did I learn today? Rotation: # of degrees, C.O.R, direction Reflection: L.O.R Translation: (x + ?, y + ?) rotating something 180 degrees makes it parallel i learned how to macht concrent angels and sides I learned what a parrellogram is wo lines that are equal have little lines on it to show they are equal like three triangles and two of them have some the lines are the same and the angles too.</description></item><item><title>Lesson 11</title><link>https://math.boskind.tech/Unit1/Lesson1.11/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://math.boskind.tech/Unit1/Lesson1.11/</guid><description>What is the same? Summary Congruent One figure is congruent to another if it can be moved with translations, rotations, and reflections to fit exactly over the other.
What did I learn today? That a side ways M means sum I relearned what factorial is after a few years gabys rude because she eases my notes I learned that i really suck at math and tests. I&amp;rsquo;m definitely failing 8th grade i relearned how to find area and perimeter for the 78943026570563rd time :) Congruent shapes have to have the same shape and size and are allowed to flip, move or turn, and angles can be congruent when they are the same size.</description></item><item><title>Lesson 12</title><link>https://math.boskind.tech/Unit1/Lesson1.12/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://math.boskind.tech/Unit1/Lesson1.12/</guid><description>Congruent Polygons Summary Congruent One figure is congruent to another if it can be moved with translations, rotations, and reflections to fit exactly over the other.
What did I learn today? Two figures can still be congruent if they are rotated or have the same type of measurements. To show two figures are congruent, you align one with the other by a sequence of rigid transformations. This is true even for figures with curved sides.</description></item><item><title>Lesson 15</title><link>https://math.boskind.tech/Unit1/Lesson1.15/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://math.boskind.tech/Unit1/Lesson1.15/</guid><description>Adding the Angles in a Triangle Summary What did I learn today? I learned that the insides of a triangle are180 degrees a line that crosses a pair of parallel lines is called a transversal and that all angles have a corresponding angle on the opposite side poooooop in a bucket and mr. boskind is my note caryer I learnd that every thing can and will need to be agnled Alternate interior angles are created when two parallel lines are crossed by another line called a transversal.</description></item><item><title>Lesson 7</title><link>https://math.boskind.tech/Unit1/Lesson1.7/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://math.boskind.tech/Unit1/Lesson1.7/</guid><description>No Bending or Stretching What did I learn Today? we learned what a rigid transformation was When two shqapes or more are the same they call it Congruent. I learned that when reflecting, the y axis doesn&amp;rsquo;t change i learnd more about translate rotate refect Equal = numbers, congruent= triangle abc = triangle a' b' c', Rigid transformation How to spell Scale Factor i learned how to do the units, for a ruler on the board i learned that a inch has 8/8 in it so we can do 1/8 I learned the difference between equal and congruent.</description></item><item><title>Lesson 8</title><link>https://math.boskind.tech/Unit1/Lesson1.8/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://math.boskind.tech/Unit1/Lesson1.8/</guid><description>Rotation Patterns What did I learn today? Any rotation 180 degrees the new line will be parallel. Any 180 degree turn is parallel &amp;lt;3 A 90-degree rotation counter-clockwise is the same as a 270-degree rotation clockwise. when you rotate 180 degrees it dosent matter what way you rotate the lines will be parallel when you rotate a line segment 180 degrees it becomes parallel. congruent is like equal but for shapes I learned that when you rotate a segment 180 degrees, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter if its clockwise or counterclockwise because it&amp;rsquo;ll go to the same spot.</description></item><item><title>Lesson1.1</title><link>https://math.boskind.tech/Unit1/Lesson1.1/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://math.boskind.tech/Unit1/Lesson1.1/</guid><description>Lesson 1.1 Unit1 Lesson 1 The lesson where Mr. Boskind dances around What did we learn? Today, we recapped on angels and vortexes. We watched some seemingly useless dance turn into a informative recap of angles and counter clockwise and clockwise. We also learned the importance of perseptiveness. Using counter clockwise and clockwise is a more efficient way of telling if the shape turns left or right, drawing a clock over the square is an easy way to tell which way it is turning.</description></item><item><title>Project Stuff</title><link>https://math.boskind.tech/miscStuff/projectStuff/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://math.boskind.tech/miscStuff/projectStuff/</guid><description>Project stuff Tinkercad Project #1 Create Your Own House with Tinkercad</description></item><item><title>Slope</title><link>https://math.boskind.tech/Unit2/Slopeofaline/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://math.boskind.tech/Unit2/Slopeofaline/</guid><description>Slope Slope is defined as the steepness, incline, or gradient of a line.

To find the slope, divide the vertical distance between the points by the horizontal distance.
The slope of this line is 2 divided by 3 or 2/3. Simply put, the slope of a line is the ratio of rise to run of a line.</description></item><item><title>Unit Test Notes</title><link>https://math.boskind.tech/Unit1/UnitTestNotes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://math.boskind.tech/Unit1/UnitTestNotes/</guid><description>Unit 1 TEST Notes I AM REALLY BAD AT MATH KAHOOTS Anything we learned so far Definitions Check out the Unit1Vocab (x+ _ Y+_) that formula All the differnt ways to do a translation Alternate interior angles are created when two parallel lines are crossed by another line called a transversal.
