Translation- slides a figure without turning it, Rotation- turns a figure about a point, called the center of rotation, and Reflection- is a transformation representing a flip of a figure.And the figure can go clockwise or counterclockwise. i learned what reflection means/ points on the opposite side of a reflection line the mirror image is a backwards copy of the original figure.</description></item><item><title>Lesson 1.3</title><link>https://math.boskind.tech/Unit1/Lesson1.3/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://math.boskind.tech/Unit1/Lesson1.3/</guid><description>Lesson 1.3 Unit1 Lesson 3
Grid Moves Today we worked with square and isometric (triangle) grids What did I learn today? I learned how to transfer and rotate objects. I learned that if I don&amp;rsquo;t go to school I wont understand math i learned how to use vectors Counterclockwise is left clockwise goes right prime is after a transformation I learned how to use GeoGebra. I learned all of the vocabulary words and what they do.</description></item><item><title>Lesson 1.4</title><link>https://math.boskind.tech/Unit1/Lesson1.4/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://math.boskind.tech/Unit1/Lesson1.4/</guid><description>Unit1 Lesson 4 Making the moves What did I learn today? I learned about translation how you need direction and distance. I learned about reflection and how you need a line of reflection and i learned about rotation and how you need degrees ccw or cc and c.o.r i learned definitions for rotations, translations, rotations and image Vector means direction and distance distence and diretion witch is what the orange dude says the relfected point is called prime that paper hats taped to your shoes can indeed harm people :) I learned about reflection and rotation and what C.</description></item><item><title>Lesson 1.5</title><link>https://math.boskind.tech/Unit1/Lesson1.5/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://math.boskind.tech/Unit1/Lesson1.5/</guid><description>Unit1 Lesson 5 Coordinate Moves Select all of the translations that take Triangle T to Triangle U. There may be more than one correct answer. What did I learn Today? Unit1Vocab coordinate plane The coordinate plane is a system for telling where points are. For example. point R is located at (3,2) on the coordinate plane, because it is three units to the right and two units up.</description></item><item><title>Lesson 1.6</title><link>https://math.boskind.tech/Unit1/Lesson1.6/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://math.boskind.tech/Unit1/Lesson1.6/</guid><description>Unit1 Lesson 6 Describing Transformations Andre performs a 90-degree counterclockwise rotation of Polygon P and gets Polygon P’, but he does not say what the center of the rotation is. Can you find the center? What did I learn Today?

Today, we recapped on angels and vortexes. We watched some seemingly useless dance turn into a informative recap of angles and counter clockwise and clockwise. We also learned the importance of perseptiveness. Using counter clockwise and clockwise is a more efficient way of telling if the shape turns left or right, drawing a clock over the square is an easy way to tell which way it is turning.</description></item><item><title>Unit 1</title><link>https://math.boskind.tech/Unit1/Unit1/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://math.boskind.tech/Unit1/Unit1/</guid><description>Unit 1 Rigid Transforations and Congruence Link to Illustrative Matehmatics - Unit 1 Vocab Lesson1 Lesson2 Lesson3 Lesson4 Lesson5 Lesson6</description></item><item><title>Unit 1 Vocab</title><link>https://math.boskind.tech/Unit1/Unit1Vocab/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://math.boskind.tech/Unit1/Unit1Vocab/</guid><description>Vocab for Unit1 A translation slides a figure without turning it. Every point in the figure goes the same distance in the same direction. For example, Figure A was translated down and to the left, as shown by the arrows. Figure B is a translation of Figure A. A rotation turns a figure about a point, called the center of the rotation. Every point on the figure goes in a circle around the center and makes the same angels .</description></item></channel></rss>
