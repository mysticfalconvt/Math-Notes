# Equation of a line

The equation of a line is the way that we represent the relationship between x and y of every point on a line.
The first form of the equation of a line that we will use is **Point Slope Form**
It is called this because it tells us the [Slope](Unit2/Slopeofaline.md) of the line and a point on the line.

The M in the equation is where we put the [Slope of the line](Unit2/Slopeofaline.md)

The point on the line is shown by (X<sub>1</sub>, Y<sub>1</sub>)

This lets us write the equation by finding the slope and then putting the X and Y value of the point into the equation.
