# Equation of a line
There are many different ways to show a lienar relationship in an equation.  During Unit 2 we used Point-Slope form of the equation of a line.  
During Unit 3 we learned about Slope Intercept (y=mx+b) and Standard Form (ax+by=c)

## Point Slope Form

The equation of a line is the way that we represent the relationship between x and y of every point on a line.
The first form of the equation of a line that we will use is **Point Slope Form**
It is called this because it tells us the [Slope](Unit2/Slopeofaline.md) of the line and a point on the line.

The M in the equation is where we put the [Slope of the line](Unit2/Slopeofaline.md)

The point on the line is shown by (X<sub>1</sub>, Y<sub>1</sub>)

This lets us write the equation by finding the slope and then putting the X and Y value of the point into the equation.


## Slope Intercept Form
### y=mx+b
We use this form of the equation of a line when wh know the starting value and a unit rate.
The m stands for the slope of the line and b stands for the y-intercept of the line. Usually, we'll be given some information, and we have to find m and b in order to plug them and get the equation of the line.

## Standard Form
### Ax +By = C
We use this form of the equation of a line when we know 2 unit rates and a total.

One of the primary advantages of using this form of the equation of a line is the ease of finding the x-intercept and the y-intercept

Suppose we want to graph the following equation by plotting its x- and y-intercepts.
**2x+5y=30**
Let's start by finding the x-intercept. To find this, we set y=0. We did this in class by covering up the y part of the equation.
2x+5y=30
2x+5(0)=30
2x=30
x=15
So the x-intercept occurs at the point (15,0).

Next, to find the y-intercept, we set x=0. We did this in class by covering the x part of the equation.
2x+5y=30
2(0)+5y=30
5y=30
y=6
The y-intercept occurs at the point (0,6).

Plotting these points, we can draw a line through them to get:

## Special Lines
### Horizontal Lines
Horizontal lines in the coordinate plane represent situations where the Y value doesn’t change at all while the X value changes. For example, the horizontal line that goes through the point (0,13) can be described in words as “for all points on the line, the Y value is always 13.” An equation that says the same thing is y=13.
The equation of this line is Y=5

### Vertical Lines
Vertical lines represent situations where the X value doesn’t change at all while the Y value changes. The equation X=-4 describes a vertical line through the point (-4,0).
The equation of this line is X=8
