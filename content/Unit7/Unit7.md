## Scientific Notation
### Scientific Notation is a special way of writing numbers to make it easier to work with very large or very small numbers

## Multiplying and Dividing Numbers Expressed in Scientific Notation

Numbers that are written in scientific notation can be multiplied and divided rather simply by taking advantage of the properties of numbers and the rules of exponents that you may recall. To multiply numbers in scientific notation, first multiply the numbers that are not powers of 10 (the a in a×10^n). Then multiply the powers of ten by adding the exponents.

This will produce a new number times a different power of 10. All you have to do is check to make sure this new value is in scientific notation. If it is not, you convert it.

In order to **divide** numbers in scientific notation, you once again apply the properties of numbers and the rules of exponents. You begin by dividing the numbers that are not powers of 10 (the _a_ in a×10^n). Then you divide the powers of ten by subtracting the exponents.

This will produce a new number times a different power of 1010. If it is not already in scientific notation, you convert it, and then you are done.
