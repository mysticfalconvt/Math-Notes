### Proprotional Relationships
Linear relationships that go through the *Origin* (0,0)

## [Slope](Unit2/Slopeofaline.md)
Also Known As:
- Rate Of Change
- Constant Of Proportionality
- Unit Rate
- **Just call it *SLOPE***

### Equation of a line in 2 forms
We did the equation of a line in *Slope Intercept form *
**Y=MX+B**


We also did the equation of a line in *Standard Form*
Ax+By=C

for more details see [Equation of a Line](Unit2/EquationofaLine.md)

## Special Lines
### Horizontal Lines
Horizontal lines in the coordinate plane represent situations where the Y value doesn’t change at all while the X value changes. For example, the horizontal line that goes through the point (0,13) can be described in words as “for all points on the line, the Y value is always 13.” An equation that says the same thing is y=13.
The equation of this line is Y=5

### Vertical Lines
Vertical lines represent situations where the X value doesn’t change at all while the Y value changes. The equation X=-4 describes a vertical line through the point (-4,0).
The equation of this line is X=8
