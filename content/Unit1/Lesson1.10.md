## What did I learn today?
- Rotation: # of degrees, C.O.R, direction Reflection: L.O.R Translation: (x + ?, y + ?)
- rotating something 180 degrees makes it parallel
- i learned how to macht concrent angels and sides
- I learned what a parrellogram is
- wo lines that are equal have little lines on it to show they are equal like three triangles and two of them have some the lines are the same and the angles too.
- how to properly label congruent angles and sides.
- i lerned to rotate a shape 180 and it is the same so you can rotate it counterclockwise or clockwise
- the pp word
- I realized that I can make a parallelogram out of an original triangle and a reflection triangle
- I learned how to show if line segments are congruent using little tic marks
