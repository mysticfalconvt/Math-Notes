## What did I learn today?
- That a side ways M means sum
- I relearned what factorial is after a few years
- gabys rude because she eases my notes
- I learned that i really suck at math and tests. I'm definitely failing 8th grade
- i relearned how to find area and perimeter for the 78943026570563rd time :)
- Congruent shapes have to have the same shape and size and are allowed to flip, move or turn, and angles can be congruent when they are the same size.
- area and perimeter
- things can have the same perimeter but not the same area
- I learned about angles again.
- shapes can have the same perimeter and not the same area or vice versa.
- That Mr. Boskind is a little rat man
