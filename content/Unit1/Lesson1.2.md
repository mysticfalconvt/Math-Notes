## Vocab
- A **translation** slides a figure without turning it. Every point in the figure goes the same distance in the same direction. For example, Figure A was translated down and to the left, as shown by the arrows. Figure B is a translation of Figure A.

- A **rotation** turns a figure about a point, called the center of the rotation. Every point on the figure goes in a circle around the center and makes the same [angels](miscStuff/angels.md). The rotation can be **clockwise**, going in the same direction as the hands of a clock, or **counterclockwise**, going in the other direction. For example, Figure A was rotated  clockwise around its bottom vertex. Figure C is a rotation of Figure A.

- A **reflection** places points on the opposite side of a reflection line. The mirror image is a backwards copy of the original figure. The reflection line shows where the mirror should stand. For example, Figure A was reflected across the dotted line. Figure D is a reflection of Figure A.

- We use the word _image_ to describe the new figure created by moving the original figure. If one point on the original figure moves to another point on the new figure, we call them _corresponding_ points.
