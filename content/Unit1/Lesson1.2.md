## What did I learn Today?
- Translation- slides a figure without turning it, Rotation- turns a figure about a point, called the center of rotation, and Reflection- is a transformation representing a flip of a figure.And the figure can go clockwise or counterclockwise.
- i learned what reflection means/ points on the opposite side of a reflection line the mirror image is a backwards copy of the original figure.
- i got reminded how to use a protractor again
- That a translation slides a figure without turning it.
- i learned to flip shapes
- How something is flipped and not turned Also how to use a protractor.
- i learnd what a reflection is it is a mieror image of ashape and it is mostly the smae shpe but turnd a round.
- I learned about three words, translation: slides a figure without turning it, rotation: turns a figure about a point, called the center of the rotation, and reflection: places points on the opposite side of the reflection line!!!!!! thx Mr. Boskin!!!!!!!!!  *Learn How To Spell My Name!!*
- A reflection points on the opposite side of a reflection line

## [Unit1Vocab](Unit1/Unit1Vocab.md)
- A **translation** slides a figure without turning it. Every point in the figure goes the same distance in the same direction. For example, Figure A was translated down and to the left, as shown by the arrows. Figure B is a translation of Figure A.

- A **rotation** turns a figure about a point, called the center of the rotation. Every point on the figure goes in a circle around the center and makes the same [angels](miscStuff/angels.md). The rotation can be **clockwise**, going in the same direction as the hands of a clock, or **counterclockwise**, going in the other direction. For example, Figure A was rotated  clockwise around its bottom vertex. Figure C is a rotation of Figure A.

- A **reflection** places points on the opposite side of a reflection line. The mirror image is a backwards copy of the original figure. The reflection line shows where the mirror should stand. For example, Figure A was reflected across the dotted line. Figure D is a reflection of Figure A.

- We use the word _image_ to describe the new figure created by moving the original figure. If one point on the original figure moves to another point on the new figure, we call them _corresponding_ points.
