## Summary
Rigid transformations have the following properties:

-   A rigid transformation of a line is a line.
    
-   A rigid transformation of two parallel lines results in two parallel lines that are the same distance apart as the original two lines.
    
-   Sometimes, a rigid transformation takes a line to itself. For example:![](/Unit1/attatchments/Pasted%20image%2020210913063912.png) ![](/Unit1/attatchments/Pasted%20image%2020210913063932.png)

## What did I learn today?
- We learned that blabby gabby and Ranty riley earnt good teachers, and also a new subject. Vertical angels. (When 2 angles cross between each other) (90) (congruent to each other)
- Vertical angles that are across from each other are congruent
- I learned vertical angles are always congruent
- being sick is not fun :D
-  learnd that paralla angels are congrtent
-  A acute angles are congruent, intersecting lines have one straight line and two angles have to add up to 180 degrees.
-  we learned about vertical angles. Vertical angles are when two lines intersect making angles.
-  180 makes the angle straight
-  i lerned that 2 angles can add to make a angle
-  When you rotate something the angles are congruent.
-  A translation is a slide and you add in on how much you slide the x and how much you slide the y.
-  I learned that you can reflect, rotate, and translate segments
-  there and names for shapes like aod because you cant just say o
