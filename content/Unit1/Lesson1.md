## The lesson where Mr. Boskind dances around

## What did we learn?
- Today, we recapped on angels and vortexes. We watched some seemingly useless dance turn into a informative recap of angles and counter clockwise and clockwise. We also learned the importance of perseptiveness.
- Using counter clockwise and clockwise is a more efficient way of telling if the shape turns left or right, drawing a clock over the square is an easy way to tell which way it is turning.
- I learned what a vertex was.
	- a vertex is the dot that connects two lines and makes a angle
- I learned that Mr.Boskind has a his own website which has a lot of links and things that can help me with my math homework or assignment.
- i learned the actual name of a 180 degree angle (a straight angle)
- I learned that mr boskind got moves
- Be descriptive with your words/directions.
- To do specific things you need clear specific directions
