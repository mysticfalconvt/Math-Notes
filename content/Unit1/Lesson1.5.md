## What did I learn Today?
- reflecting just remember where to stick the negative sign. (x,-y)x-axs. (-x,y)y axs.
- when reflecting over y,x axis just find the point and put a - sign.
- When the x axes is the reflection line y gets - When the y axes is the reflective line gets -
- We learned that x comes before y in coordinates.
- when it reflects over the X (x,-y), when it reflects over the Y (-x,y)
- when the x axis is the mirror the y value changes and when the y axis is the mirror the x value canges
- I learned that when a point is on the mirror line, it doesn't move when you mirror it because it's on the line so it doesn't move
- I learned how to place a point on a grid and properly read coordinates.
- where the X and Y axis are because i did not remember

## [Unit1Vocab](Unit1/Unit1Vocab.md)
- **coordinate plane**
	- The coordinate plane is a system for telling where points are. For example. point R  is located at (3,2) on the coordinate plane, because it is three units to the right and two units up. ![](/Unit1/attatchments/Pasted%20image%2020210902063943.png)
- **Vertex**
	- A vertex is a point where two or more edges meet. When we have more than one vertex, we call them vertices. ![](/Unit1/attatchments/Pasted%20image%2020210902064038.png)
