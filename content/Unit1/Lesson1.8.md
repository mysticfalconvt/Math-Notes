## What did I learn today?
- Any rotation 180 degrees the new line will be parallel.
- Any 180 degree turn is parallel <3
- A 90-degree rotation counter-clockwise is the same as a 270-degree rotation clockwise.
- when you rotate 180 degrees it dosent matter what way you rotate the lines will be parallel
- when you rotate a line segment 180 degrees it becomes parallel. congruent is like equal but for shapes
- I learned that when you rotate a segment 180 degrees, it doesn't matter if its clockwise or counterclockwise because it'll go to the same spot. Also, all lines will be parallel.
- 180 degree rotations can go either wyay and end up in the same spot.
- Although I wasn't here for a lot of it, We learned that if you rotate around a center point 180 degrees, it doesn't matter if its clockwise or counterclockwise as it will always get at the same place.

## Summary
When we apply a 180-degree rotation to a line segment, there are several possible outcomes:

-   The segment maps to itself (if the center of rotation is the midpoint of the segment).
-   The image of the segment overlaps with the segment and lies on the same line (if the center of rotation is a point on the segment).
-   The image of the segment does not overlap with the segment (if the center of rotation is _not_ on the segment).
