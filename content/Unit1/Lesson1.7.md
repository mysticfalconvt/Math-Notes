# What did I learn Today?
- we learned what a rigid transformation was
- When two shqapes or more are the same they call it Congruent.
- I learned that when reflecting, the y axis doesn't change
- i learnd more about translate rotate refect
- Equal = numbers, congruent= triangle abc = triangle a' b' c', Rigid transformation
- How to spell Scale Factor
- i learned how to do the units, for a ruler on the board
- i learned that a inch has 8/8 in it so we can do 1/8
- I learned the difference between equal and congruent.
- A ridged transformation is a transformation that does not change the images shape or sides.
- congruent is equal for shapes

#[Unit1Vocab](Unit1/Unit1Vocab.md)

- **Corresponding** When part of an original figure matches up with part of a copy, we call them corresponding parts. These could be points, segments, angles, or distances.

For example, point  in the first triangle corresponds to point  in the second triangle. Segment  corresponds to segment . ![](/Unit1/attatchments/Pasted%20image%2020210909062210.png)

- **Rigid Transformation** A rigid transformation is a move that does not change any measurements of a figure. Translations, rotations, and reflections are rigid transformations, as is any sequence of these.
