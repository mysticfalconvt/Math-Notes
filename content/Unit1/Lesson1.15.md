## What did I learn today?
- I learned that the insides of a triangle are180 degrees
- a line that crosses a pair of parallel lines is called a transversal and that all angles have a corresponding angle on the opposite side
- poooooop in a bucket and mr. boskind is my note caryer
- I learnd that every thing can and will need to be agnled
- Alternate interior angles are created when two parallel lines are crossed by another line called a transversal. Alternate interior angles are inside the parallel lines and on opposite sides of the transversal.
- i learned what a alternet interieor angle is
- A triangle's angles must have a combined sum of 180
- 90 +a number -180
- I learned how to find a angle of a tiangle
- how to do Isosceles angle that we learned two days ago.
- I learned that Mr. Boskinds favorite angle is a isosceles angle
- I learned there are 16 angles in 2 squares that are diagonals from each other.
- that i'm horrible at multiplying by 11
- That all the angles on a triangle have to equal 180 degrees.
