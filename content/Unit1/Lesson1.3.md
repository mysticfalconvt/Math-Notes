# Lesson 1.3
[Unit1](Unit1/Unit1.md) Lesson 3

## Grid Moves
### Today we worked with square and isometric (triangle) grids

## What did I learn today?
- I learned how to transfer and rotate objects.
- I learned that if I don't go to school I wont understand math
- i learned how to use vectors
- Counterclockwise is left clockwise goes right
- prime is after a transformation
- I learned how to use GeoGebra.
- I learned all of the vocabulary words and what they do.
- i learnd how to build a hose in the three d world and i lened gow to move shapes in 4 ways
- i learned that the more house plants, the better.
- I learned how to use a vector tools, rotate tools, reflection tools, and translate tools, with a triangle and a quadrilateral.
- Today I learned as a student the importance of angels, and Degrees! and learned a bit more with tinkercad. and the importance of shapes in math.
- About a new kind of grid with equilateral triangles instead of sqaures
- i learned my shapes and a different type of grid and y you should use that type of grid
- i learned that a triangle with all equal sides is called a equallaral

## [Unit1Vocab](Unit1/Unit1Vocab.md)

When a figure is on a grid, we can use the grid to describe a transformation. For example, here is a figure and an **image** of the figure after a move.

Quadrilateral ABCD is translated 4 units to the right and 3 units down to the position of quadrilateral A'B'C'D'.

A second type of grid is called an _isometric grid_. The isometric grid is made up of equilateral triangles. The angles in the triangles all measure 60 degrees, making the isometric grid convenient for showing rotations of 60 degrees.
