## Summary
**Congruent**
One figure is congruent to another if it can be moved with translations, rotations, and reflections to fit exactly over the other.

- When two parallel lines are cut by another line, called a **transversal**, two pairs of **alternate interior angles** are created. (“Interior” means on the inside, or between, the two parallel lines.) For example, in this figure angles 3 and 5 are alternate interior angles and angles 4 and 6 are also alternate interior angles.

## What did I learn today?
- that i'm horrible at multiplying by 11
- That all the angles on a triangle have to equal 180 degrees.
- My classmates said we learned that A transversal is a line the crosses parallel lines
- nothing because im not in school :(
- i learned the meaning of the word transversal :)
- A line that intersects a pair of parallel lines is called a transversal
- I learned how to make a pin in think tink
- that I can do impossible shapes
- Transversal And I learned how to aim for solans forehead!!!!!!!!!!!!
- how to display paralel and that soulin hates markers now
- That only parallel lines work for the same congruent degrees
- a transversal is a line that crosses between 2 parallel lines
- I learned that you can get an apposing angle by subtracting the angle size from 180
- line that crosses to parallel lines=transversal
