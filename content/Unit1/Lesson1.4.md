## What did I learn today?
- I learned about translation how you need direction and distance. I learned about reflection and how you need a line of reflection and i learned about rotation and how you need degrees ccw or cc and c.o.r
- i learned definitions for rotations, translations, rotations and image
> - Vector means direction and distance
> distence and diretion witch is what the orange dude says

- the relfected point is called prime
- that paper hats taped to your shoes can indeed harm people :)
- I learned about reflection and rotation and what C.O.R. means
- Double prime, Translation-distance+ direction, Rotate-deg. C.O.R. + direction(CW/CCW), and Reflection- LIne of reflection
- i learn that a reflection can be turned in multapul difrent ways and hat therev are more than 4 difent types of stuf that we are lerning.
- Translations needs A direction and a amount. Rotations needs a degree, clockwise or counter-clockwise C.O.R (Center Of Rotation). Reflection L.O.R
- That if you want to prime something it's a'' a double prime
- A sequence of transformation is a more than 1 step process to either rotate, transition or reflect a image.
- I learned that when you rotate a prime dotted shape, the rotated shape will be a double prime shape
- Rotation has 3 parts to work. C.O.R, Dey. Direction (Counterclockwise, clockwise)

## [Unit1Vocab](Unit1/Unit1Vocab.md)
A move, or combination of moves, is called a **transformation**. When we do one or more moves in a row, we often call that a **sequence of transformations**. To distinguish the original figure from its image, points in the image are sometimes labeled with the same letters as the original figure, but with the symbol  attached, as in  A' (pronounced “A prime”).

**sequence of transformations**

A sequence of transformations is a set of translations, rotations, reflections, and dilations on a figure. The transformations are performed in a given order.

This diagram shows a sequence of transformations to move Figure A to Figure C.

First, A is translated to the right to make B. Next, B is reflected across line  to make C.
