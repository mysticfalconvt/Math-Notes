## Summary
**Congruent**
One figure is congruent to another if it can be moved with translations, rotations, and reflections to fit exactly over the other.

## What did I learn today?
- Two figures can still be congruent if they are rotated or have the same type of measurements.
- To show two figures are congruent, you align one with the other by a sequence of rigid transformations. This is true even for figures with curved sides. Distances between corresponding points on congruent figures are always equal, even for curved shapes. For example, corresponding segments and on these congruent ovals have the same length.
- i learned that mr.boskind can print anything that is wierd shaped.
- I learned how to show if line segments are congruent to each other
- I learned that congruent each side has to be the same length.
- I learned that a rotation needs the degrees wrote down
- Mr. Boskind had to buy a new frisbee
- You have to look closely at an image/shape to find out if it is/isn't congruent
- i learned that shapes can have the same line of lagnth but still be the same size
- If i creepily follow logan around with a long paper finger, he'll scream like a child :)
- that if there is things in the shape was not concrernt but the shape is concreant the shapes are not concrent because everything has to be the same.
- That you can't find a corresponding segment that doesn't have the same angle in a congruent shapes. And if you have to ovals but the ovals are the same doesn't mean the things on the inside are the same
- I learned was that mr boskind was dangiling from a cliff by his backpack
- i learned nothing because i was never taught. also online school sucks more than i thought :)
- rotated shapes can still be congruent to normal shapes
- all line segemnts on a cungruent shape are congruent
- I learned you shouldnÂ´t only rely on your eyes to know if something is congruent and to actually measure
