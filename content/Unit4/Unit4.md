# Unit 4 - Linear Equations and Linear Systems

## [Unit 4 Vocab](Unit4/unit4vocab.md)


## Solving equations
### In fact, solving an equation is just like solving a puzzle. And like puzzles, there are things we can (and cannot) do.

#### Here are some things we can do:

-   [Add or Subtract](https://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/introduction.html) the same value from both sides
-   Clear out any fractions by [Multiplying](https://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/introduction-multiply.html) every term by the bottom parts
-   Divide every term by the same nonzero value
-   [Combine Like Terms](https://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/like-terms.html)


## Number of solutions
- Most equations will have 1 solution.
	- This looks like ** X = Some Number **
	- This happens any time that the two sides of the equation have a different number of variable terms.
		- 3x+5=9
		- 3x+5=2x-4
- Some times an equation has a matching number of variable terms on each side.  ðŸ””ðŸ””ðŸ””ðŸ””ðŸ””
	- If the variables match then they will cancel out.
		- 3x+5=3x+5
		- 3x+5=3x+2
	- In these special cases we must check the constant terms (The just numbers) on each side.
		- If they match there are infinite solutions.  This means any value for x will satisfy the equation.
			- 3x+5=3x+5
			- 2x=2x
			- x+5 = x+5
		- If they do not match there is no solution to the equation.
			- 3x+5 = 3x+2
			- 2x = 2x+5
			- x+5 = x
