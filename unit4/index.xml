It will have an equals sign &amp;ldquo;=&amp;rdquo; like this: x-2=4
That equations says: what is on the left (x âˆ’ 2) is equal to what is on the right (4)
So an equation is like a statement &amp;ldquo;this equals that&amp;rdquo;
Solution A Solution is a value we can put in place of a variable (such as x) that makes the equation true.</description></item></channel></rss>
